I'm sure that many of you has some experience with the computer games. Have you ever had a desire to change the game in such way that the characters or game world will look more appropriate to your picture of the perfect game? Probably, yes.<br>
In this mission (and in the few subsequent, linked to this one) you will have a chance "to sit in the developer's chair" and create a logic of the simple game about battles.<br>
Let's start with the simple task - 1 vs 1 duel. In this mission you have to create the class <strong>Warrior</strong>, whose instances will have 2 parameters - health (equals to 50 points) and attack (equals to 5 points) and 1 property - is_alive which could be True (if warrior's health is > 0) or False (in the other case). Also you should create a function <strong>fight()</strong>, which will make the duels between 2 warriors and define the strongest of them. The duel will happens like this:<br>
every turn the first warrior will hit the second and the second will lose his health in the same value as the attack of the first warrior. After that, the second warrior will do the same to the first.<br>
If in the end of the turn first warrior has > 0 health and the other one is not, the function should return <strong>True</strong> and it should return <strong>False</strong> in the other case.

<strong>Example</strong>:
<pre class="brush: python">
chuck = Warrior()
bruce = Warrior()
    
fight(chuck, bruce) == True
chuck.is_alive == True
bruce.is_alive == False
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong>warriors.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong>True or False.

    For the computer games development.

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    health == 50<br>
    attack == 5
