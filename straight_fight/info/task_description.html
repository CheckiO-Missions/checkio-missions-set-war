... despite all the tactical moves undertaken, no victory was given to either side. 
Therefore, the two army commanders decided to change tactics and send soldiers into battle not one by one, but immediately arrange a battle of all survivors against all.
</div>

<p>
In this mission won't added a new type of the units, but will add a new tactics - <strong>straight_fight</strong>(army_1, army_2). It should be the method of the class Battle and it should work in this way:<br>
at the beginning there will be a few duels between each pair of soldiers from the first and second armies (the first unit against the first, the second against the second and so on). After that all dead soldiers will removed from the both armies and the process repeats until all soldiers of one of the army will be dead. In the initial composition of the armies may not be the same number of soldiers. If for the warriors there is no opponent from the enemy army - wew will assume that they automatically win a duel (for example - 9th and 10th units from the first army, if the second has only 8 soldiers).
